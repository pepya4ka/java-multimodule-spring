This is a **test / practice project** created to explore and practice building a **multi-module Java
application**.

## Tech Stack

The project demonstrates usage of the following technologies:

- Java
- Spring Framework
- Gradle (multi-module setup)
- jOOQ for type-safe SQL and database access
- Liquibase for database migrations

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to practice:

- Designing a multi-module architecture
- Integrating jOOQ with Spring
- Managing database schema with Liquibase
- Writing and testing jOOQ-based repositories

This project is intended for learning and experimentation rather than production use.
